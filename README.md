# Portfolio #

https://trepear.github.io/Portfolio/

This project utilized Bootsrap and vanilla CSS to create a functioning "portfolio" website. Media queries were supposed to be added in order to promote responsive web-design. 

This portfolio is definitely a work in progress and this is by no means a finished or polished project. To do moving forward:
-  Fix layout issues (footer)
- Add appropriate media queries
- Add text about myself
- ETC.
