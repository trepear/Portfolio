This project utilized Bootsrap and vanilla CSS to create a functioning "portfolio" website. Media queries were supposed to be added in order to promote responsive web-design. 

# IN THE PROCESS OF CREATING A MORE UNIQUE PORTFOLIO
This portfolio, while okay, is not an accurate representation of how I want to showcase my work online. I am currently in the process of creating a cleaner/more engaging portfolio that I will submit under the "UniquePorfolio" repo on my GitHub account!
